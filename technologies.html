                                    <p style= font-size:9px;text-align:justify;> Cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency created from code. Cryptocurrency could be a digital payment method that does not depend upon the banks to verify transactions, alternatively, then being physical money that has to be carried around and exchange for goods and services. Cryptocurrency payment essentially only exists as a digital entirety to an online database.<br>  

Cryptocurrency utilises blockchain technology. Blockchain technology refers to a form of database. Database stores a body of data/ information electronically onto an automatic data processing system which mainly stores information into a table format. By storing in such form, it allows data to promptly be searched and filtered. Though blockchain is referred as a sort of database, it differs within the way data it's structured. Blockchain collects data together into groups mentioned as ‘blocks’, this is often set information. These blocks have a limited capacity and after they're filled, they're linked the too previous filled block, somewhat like how DNA is linked. Hence the term ‘Blockchain’ comes from the conjoining of filled blocks. The strategy of blockchain is when a replacement transaction is entered the transaction is then transmitted to a network of computers scatted across the world. Thus, networks of computers then solve equations to substantiate the validity of the transaction. The transaction then becomes complete. These blocks are then chained together creating as long history of all transactions that are permanent. Once confirmed to be legitimate transactions, they're clustered together in to blocks.<br>  

Bitcoin is a digital currency created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. Its main objective is to supply the promise of lower transaction fees when put next to traditional bank transfer fees like government issued currencies. Bitcoin runs as a decentralised system which records transactions into a distributed ledger referred to as ‘blockchain.’ Decentralised system was first made possible due to blockchain technology, with the first ever blockchain being ‘Bitcoin.’ A decentralised system implies the exclusion of one central owner when compared to a centralized system. decentralised system uses multiple central owners, each individual owner usually has a copy of information users can access. Hence when somebody sends bitcoin to another person, the transaction isn’t verified by one centralized command. Alternatively, anybody can hook up their laptop/computer to the bitcoin system to aid in the verification in the movement of funds. Furthermore, there are thousands independent systems helping to operate the network.<br>

Due to the nature of bitcoin’s blockchain being decentralized, all transactions are transparently viewed by either having a ‘personal node’ (is a tiny, wallet sized device that integrates people into the net.) or with the employment of ‘blockchain explorer’ (severs as an exploration engine for data within a blockchain network and allows users to access different details referring to transactions on specific wallet addressees and blockchains.) That permits anyone to work out transactions occurring live. Each node has its own copy of the chain that gets updated as fresh filled blocks are confirmed and added. This mean that if you wanted to, you could track bitcoin when and wherever it goes.<br>  

Blockchain technology accounts for the problems of security and trust in a magnitude of ways. First, new blocks are always stored linearly and chronologically. After a block has been added to the tip of the blockchain, it's very difficult to travel back and alter the contents of the block unless the bulk reached a consensus to try and do so. Therefore it is harder to make alteration to benefit one another.<br> 2. In this day and age, Cryptocurrency has become one of the biggest currencies, with the violate rise of Bitcoin many people have shown interest and the prospect of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency will continue to evolve until it become the mainstream currency around the world. As seen on the news, Cryptocurrency is starting to become a payment method. E.g., Bitcoin. With people such as Elon Musk allowing people to use ‘Bitcoin’ as a viable method of payment. There is no extent to what crypto is capable of. As cryptocurrency is a convenient and practical way to make transaction that does not depend upon the banks to verifying transactions, it has become a topic of debate. Not only due to its prompt digital payment but also is security aspect.<br>

 Cryptocurrency offers blockchain technology which records transaction in to blocks and times stamps them, thus it is less likely to be hacked. In addition, transactions require two step verifications. Cryptocurrency has made its marks on the economy, politics and social life of individuals. Even to this day, poverty still remains unacceptably high, worldwide and it is increasingly clear that the benefits of economic growth have hasn’t been shared evenly across regions and countries. Alongside with economic chaos, civil wars and governmental collapse, poverty is driven by economic factors.<br> 

 Cryptocurrencies can provide a significant benefit for overcoming the lack of social trust. By increasing the access to financial services, it can act as a medium to support growth in developing countries by increasing financial inclusion, providing better traceability of funds and to assist people find the way through poverty. Cryptocurrency is taken into account to be advantageous within the developing countries because of its transparency, which allows trust free interaction between respective each other. this can be feasible thanks to blockchain technology, providing better traceability of funds and to help people find a way through poverty.  This Is a safer means of payment as it is decentralized, hence forth, it is not managed by the government.<br> 

People have considered that all cryptocurrencies need exchanged traded funds (EFT), as it would improve the efficiency for people investing in crypto(bitcoin).<br> 

 

3. Considering how popular cryptocurrency is these days, I have already considered to invest money onto it. In my daily life I would consider as a way to invest money for the future. e.g., waiting for a currency to hit it big like how ‘bitcoin’ did. Other than that, did does not affect me personally in a considerable manner. In the future I believe cryptocurrency will be used more as a form of payment for goods and services. Cryptocurrency has It already made its way as a method to purchase a car, hence will likely see an increase in the way it can be used. In the future cryptocurrency could be used by my family as a means of giving money overseas because it may be easier and would have lower fees.<br>
